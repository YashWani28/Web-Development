    <h1>HTML entities</h1>
    <p>HTML entities are used to write characters that are reserved for the html syntax
    </p>
    <!--* &lt stands for less than and gt stands for greater than...so we will get <p> printed on the webpage...each reserved symbol has a entity code which can be found on the internet -->
    <p>Using angular bracket: &lt p &gt</p> 

    <!--* HTML by default cannot understand spaces...all spaces wrtiiten are converted to a single space. So if we want to add more spaces, we use the entity &nbsp -->
    <p>Here are 3 spaces:&nbsp&nbsp&nbspasdfasd</p>

    <!--* Here us a special copy right character -->
    <p>Special character: &copy</p>
